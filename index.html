  <h1>Uropi</h1>
  <h3>International Auxiliary Language</h3>
  <p>Uropi was created by Joël Landais an English teacher and comparative linguist in France. It is based on the Indo-European roots and grammatical structures that are common to European languages. The Indo-European family is the largest language family in the world and Indo-European languages are spoken on the five continents. Thus the largest number of speakers in the world can feel at home with Uropi.</p>
